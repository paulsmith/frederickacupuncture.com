      Nancy, this experience has made me more aware of myself and my place
      in the universe

      The physical improvements after these sessions have been relief of
      chronic knee pain from an old injury, an increased peak flow and no
      exacerbations of asthma for the first time in 2 years. In general felt
      as though I had a whole body tune up as well as a lightening up of an
      often too serious mind.

    <p class="lead explanation">
      Traditional Five Element Acupuncture is a powerful system of medicine
      designed to address patients on a body, mind and spirit level. Practiced
      for over 3000 years in China, the benefit of acupuncture treatment is now
      clearly recognized and well documented in western medical journals and in
      medical institutions across the United States. Because of its relatively
      low cost and its noninvasive nature, acupuncture has become a highly
      popular form of complementary health care. In this gentle form of
      medicine, each treatment is designed uniquely to address imbalance as it
      is specifically experienced by each individual.
