Welcome to the new website!. My niece’s son created it using some of the
content from the other site. I love the blue and gray look. So much of
acupuncture is about movement, and color inspires a sense of movement that
goes along with it’s mood. Summer with its great variety of color and shapes
inspires movement in every way. Happy Summer!
