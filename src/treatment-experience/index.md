![An acupuncture needle](/img/slides/needle.jpg) The first appointment is
typically a two-hour consultation. During this visit we will speak at length
about your health concerns and address any questions you may have about
acupuncture and the healing process. We will also discuss your health and
personal histories in detail, followed by a physical examination. The primary
objective of the first appointment is to assess the underlying conditions that
have led to your current concerns. Following the initial consultation, ideally
you will be seen in weekly one-hour sessions for 6-8 visits. During this time,
significant signs of progress will likely appear. As patients experience
improvement in their condition and enjoy a greater sense of ease in life,
treatments may be extended to every other week, every three weeks, monthly and
eventually seasonally.

Each person is considered a unique individual, not a collection of symptoms to
be fixed. Mind, body and spirit are intricately interwoven as components of an
inseparable whole. By focusing on resolving the root cause of symptoms,
acupuncturists are often able to offer patients more than temporary relief
from difficult ailments. Through the course of treatment patients learn how to
better tend themselves and pay attention to the signals of their bodies. Most
importantly patients often discover the tremendous healing potential that
exists within and the power they have in creating wellness in their lives.
