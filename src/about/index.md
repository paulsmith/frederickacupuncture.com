![A foot receiving acupuncture](/img/slides/foot.jpg) Acupuncture is the
oldest continuously practiced medical system in the world and is used by one
third of the worldâ€™s population as a primary health care system. It is likely
that more people have been treated by Chinese  and Asian medicine throughout
history than by any other formalized system of medicine.  Because of its
relatively low cost and its noninvasive nature, acupuncture has become a
highly popular form of complementary health care in the United States. The
World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed acupuncture treatment for over 40
conditions, including stress, digestive disorders, depression, allergies,
sleeping disorders, addictions, headaches and menstrual disorders.

Acupuncture is meant to allow the movement of chi. Chi or qi is the movement
of energy and information in the body. The movement of chi can keep the
healthy person healthy and ameliorate the discomforts and fatigue of short
term and chronic illness.  Acupuncture affects the body, mind, and spirit. In
times of personal growth and transformation the presence of this subtle but
profound intervention can be powerfully supportive.
