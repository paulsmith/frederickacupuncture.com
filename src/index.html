      title: About acupuncture
      caption: >
        Acupuncture is the oldest continuously practiced medical system in the
        world and is used by one third of the world’s population as a primary
        health care system.  Because of its relatively low cost and its
        noninvasive nature, acupuncture has become a highly popular form of
        complementary health.

      title: Benefits of acupuncture
      caption: >
        Acupuncture is often effective with a wide range of complaints,
        including chronic fatigue, depression, back pain, joint pain,
        infertility, asthma, addictions, trauma symptoms and stress.
        Acupuncture is also helpful for many chronic illnesses and health
        concerns that have no clear origin or cause.

        The first appointment is typically a two-hour consultation.  During this
        visit we will speak at length about your health concerns and address any
        questions you may have about acupuncture and the healing process. We
        will also discuss your health and personal histories in detail, followed
        by a physical examination. The primary objective of the first
        appointment is to assess the underlying conditions that have led to your
        current concerns.

        Nancy Smith, RN, M.Ac., L.Ac., Somatic Experiencing
        Practitioner&trade;, Licensed Acupuncturist, Retired Registered Nurse
        with extensive clinical experience. Five Element Acupuncture helped me
        through some health challenges, so I wanted to share this way to
        access one’s own healing resources. Therefore, even though I had a
        good career as a nurse, I became an acupuncturist.

        Nancy, this experience has made me more aware of myself and my place

        The physical improvements after these sessions have been relief of
        chronic knee pain from an old injury, an increased peak flow and no
        exacerbations of asthma for the first time in 2 years. In general felt
        as though I had a whole body tune up as well as a lightening up of an
        often too serious mind.

<p class="lead">Traditional Five Element Acupuncture is a powerful system
of medicine designed to address patients on a body, mind and spirit level.
Practiced for over 3000 years in China, the benefit of acupuncture
treatment is now clearly recognized and well documented in western medical
journals and in medical institutions across the United States. Because of
its relatively low cost and its noninvasive nature, acupuncture has become
a highly popular form of complementary health care. In this gentle form of
medicine, each treatment is designed uniquely to address imbalance as it
is specifically experienced by each individual.</p>
