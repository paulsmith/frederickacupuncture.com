**Nancy Smith, RN, M.Ac., L.Ac., LLC**  
Somatic Experiencing Practitioner TM

 * Licensed Acupuncturist
 * Retired Registered Nurse with extensive clinical experience

Five Element Acupuncture helped me through some health challenges, so I wanted
to share this way to access one’s own healing resources.  Therefore, even
though I had a good career as a nurse, I became an acupuncturist.  The
practice of acupuncture draws on my life experiences and interests.  When you
put yourself on the path of learning more experiences come your way; so I was
introduced to Somatic Experiencing™  a short term naturalistic treatment for
those who have experienced trauma. See [traumahealing.com](http://traumahealing.com/).

I am on the clinical faculty at TAI Sophia and am member of the Maryland
Acupuncture Society.
