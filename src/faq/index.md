<dt>How do I get the most out of each treatment?</dt>

<dt>How does acupuncture work?</dt>
<dd>This highly effective system of medical care is based on natural laws, which govern the movement of vital life giving energy, both in nature and in the body. This energy, called chi, moves through the body in precise channels supporting functions of the body, mind and spirit. When the chi is moving disharmoniously, imbalance begins to surface in the form of specific symptoms. To address the underlying cause of a condition, these symptoms are viewed in relationship to the totality of a person in order to explore the root cause of a condition or illness. The gentle insertion of hair thin needles at specific points along the channels of chi energy, help restore harmony at the deepest level of the body, mind, and spirit. In the presence of this subtle yet profound intervention, symptoms often resolve and patients frequently experience deep personal transformation.</dd>
